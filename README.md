# react_exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This weather app checks your geolocation and a current month. Based on that it recommends you to stay home because it's cold or to hit the beach.
This is a simple exercise based on a tutorial by Steven Grider.
